\maketitle
\textbf{problem statement:} Suppose we have four box A,B,C and D containing coloured marbles as given below:
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Box & Red & White & Black\\
\hline
A & 1&6&3\\
B&6&2&2\\
C&8&1&1\\
D&0&6&4\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
one of the box has been selected at random and a single marble is drawn from it.If the marble is red.What is the probability that it was drawn from box A?Box B?Box C?
\\
\textbf{Solution:}
Here we are having 4 boxes with 10 balls each.There is a equal likelihood of selecting  four boxes
\\
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
R&Event that Red marble is drawn\\
\hline
A&Event that marble is drawn from Box A\\
\hline
B&Event that marble is drawn from Box B\\
\hline
C&Event that marble is drawn from Box C\\
\hline
D&Event that marble is drawn from Box D\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
Suppose
P(A): probability that  Box A is selected  $=\frac{1}{
4}$
\\We are having 1 red balls in box A,so probability of getting the red ball from box A is given by

P(R/A): probability that Red marble is selected given it is from Box A $=\frac{1}{10}$
\begin{flushleft}
P(B): probability that  Box B is selected  $=\frac{1}{
4}$
\\We are having 6 red balls in box B,so probability of getting the red ball from box B is given by
\\P(R/B): probability that Red marble is selected from Box B $=\frac{6}{10}$

P(C): probability that  Box C is selected  $=\frac{1}{
4}$
\\We are having 8 red balls in box C,so probability of getting the red ball from box C is given by
\\P(R/C): probability that Red marble is selected from Box C $=\frac{8}{10}$

P(D): probability that  Box D is selected  $=\frac{1}{
4}$.
\\We are having 0 red balls in box D,so probability of getting the red ball from box D is given by

P(R/D): probability that Red marble is selected from Box D $=0$
\\
Since red balls are in all the three boxes.The probability that selected ball is red is given by
\newpage
P(R):Probability of getting a Red marble
\end{flushleft}
\begin{align*}
&=\text{P(A)P(R/A)+P(B)P(R/B)}\\
&\quad +\text{P(C)P(R/C)+P(D)P(R/D)}\\
&=\frac{1}{4}\times\frac{1}{10}+\frac{1}{4}\times\frac{6}{10}+\frac{1}{4}\times\frac{8}{10}\\
&=\frac{1}{4}(\frac{1}{10}+\frac{6}{10}+\frac{8}{10})\\
&=\frac{1}{4}\times\frac{3}{2}
\end{align*}

\section{\title{\textbf{Part A}}}

P(A/R):probability that marble is drawn from box A given it is Red marble.By using bayes theorem
\begin{align*}
&=\frac{\text{P(R/A)}.\text{P(A)}}{\text{P(R)}}
\\
&=\frac{\frac{1}{10}\times\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{4}\times\frac{3}{2}}
\\
&=\frac{1}{15}
\\
\end{align*}

\section{\title{\textbf{Part B}}}

P(B/R):probability that marble is drawn from box B given it is Red marble.By using bayes theorem
\begin{align*}
    \\
&=\frac{\text{P(R/B)}.\text{P(B)}}{\text{P(R)}}
\\
&=\frac{\frac{6}{10}\times\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{4}\times\frac{3}{2}}
\\
&=\frac{2}{5}
\\
\end{align*}

\section{\title{\textbf{part C}}}

P(C/R):probability that marble is drawn from box C given it is Red marble.By using bayes theorem
\begin{align*}
    \\
&=\frac{\text{P(R/C)}.\text{P(C)}}{\text{P(R)}}
\\
&=\frac{\frac{8}{10}\times\frac{1}{4}}{\frac{1}{4}\times\frac{3}{2}}
\\
&=\frac{8}{15}
\end{align*}
