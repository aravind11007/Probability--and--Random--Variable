\textbf{Problem statement:} The probability that student is not a swimmer is 1/5. Then the probability that out of five students, four are swimmers is?
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
    \item $^{5}C_4(4/5)^{4}(1/5)$
    \item $(4/5)^4(1/5)$
    \item $^{5}C_1(4/5)^4(1/5)$
    \item None of the above
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Solution}: Let X be the number of swimmers.

$p=\frac{4}{5}$ (probability that student is swimmer) \&
$q=\frac{1}{5}$ (probability that student is not swimmer),
$n=5$ (number of students).
From Bernoulli's distribution we know that, 
$$P(X=r)=^{n}C_rp^{r}q^{n-r}$$.
Here, $p=\frac{4}{5},q=\frac{1}{5}, n=5$ and $r=4$. Therefore, $P(4)=^{5}C_4(\frac{4}{5})^{4}(\frac{1}{5})$.\\
Hence the answer is option \textbf{(a)}.
